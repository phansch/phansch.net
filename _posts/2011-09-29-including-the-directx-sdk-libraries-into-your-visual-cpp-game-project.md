If you are new to DirectX game programming, you might have come across this pitfall:



You added the DirectX header to your main file and it didn't compile because the files couldn't be found.

    
    #include <d3d11.h>
    #include <d3dx11.h>
    #include <d3dx10.h>

Fortunately, solving this problem is relatively straightforward.

## Downloading the DirectX SDK


You will need the DirectX SDK Libraries from Microsoft. These contain the aforementioned header files and libraries. Download the latest DirectX SDK from [here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/directx/aa937788).
When the download is complete, proceed by installing the DirectX SDK. Make sure you remember the installation location as you will need this later.

In order to tell Visual Studio that your game requires DirectX, you will have to add the DirectX libraries and header files to your project.
	
  1. Open your project setting
  2. Navigate to _VC++ Directories_
  3. On the right, select _Includepaths_
  4. A new window will open, that lets you new include paths. Add a new include path by hitting the _New Row_ button in the top right.
  5. Now you will have to navigate to your DirectX SDK installation directory and select the Include folder.

Do the same for the library path and you project should compile properly.

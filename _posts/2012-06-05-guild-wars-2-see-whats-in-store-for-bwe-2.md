> It’s almost here—the second Guild Wars 2 Beta Weekend Event begins this Friday! For three days, players from all over the world will experience the wonders and dangers of Tyria—and a ton of cool new content!

ArenaNet just published a new blog detailing what changes we can expect for BWE #2.

Here are my personal favorites:

  * Improved Overflow Servers
  * Key Bindings
  * Chat Bubbles
  * Resizable Map

Head over to the [ArenaNet blog](http://www.arena.net/blog/the-big-beta-weekend-preview) to see what else ArenaNet has been working on.

<p>I'm incredibly thankful to the following people for sponsoring my open source
work this past month: <a href="https://github.com/repi">@repi</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oli-obk">@oli-obk</a> and <a href="https://github.com/yaahc">@yaahc</a>.</p>
<p>If you like what I'm doing and want to support my work, please <a href="https://phansch.net/thanks">consider sponsoring</a> ♥</p>
<h2 id="what-i-ve-worked-on">What I've worked on</h2>
<p>If you're familiar with how this website looks, you can probably tell that it
has a slightly new look. Also, if you were to look into my personal documents
directory, you could most likely tell that it had been recently cleaned and
organized …again. Hello procrastination!</p>
<p>Looking at <a href="https://phansch.net/2019/12/02/monthly-review-november/">the November
review</a>, I have to
admit that I didn't follow through with all the goals I wrote down:</p>
<ul>
<li>I absolutely did not continue with the tiny compiler. I'm currently stuck on
implementing the visitor and I'm honestly not sure if it's worth it to
continue</li>
<li>I reviewed <em>some</em> Clippy PRs, but I've felt a lack of motivation in reviewing
for some reason. I also didn't contribute as much as I used to</li>
</ul>
<p>I did a few other things, though:</p>
<p>I now have a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/philhansch">Patreon page</a>! Setting up
Patreon required a lot more work than setting up GitHub sponsoring and I'm still
not 100% happy with it. I would like a nicer header image and improve on the
goals a bit as well.</p>
<p>Apart from the Patreon page, I've been working through Ralf Jung's <a href="https://www.ralfj.de/projects/rust-101/main.html">Rust
101</a> course to check up on my Rust fundamentals. What I like most
about this course is the focus on exercises. As a result of the course I created
about 25 new flashcards mostly around raw pointers and <code>std::sync</code>.</p>
<p>I also <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pull/4911">updated the Clippy changelog</a> for Rust 1.39 and 1.40.</p>
<h2 id="reflections-goals-for-january">Reflections &amp; Goals for January</h2>
<p><strong>This January</strong> I want to try and find my Clippy/Rust motivation again. I think,
after we finished completing the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/3630">rustfix testing issue</a> in
September, I was lacking a new clearly defined goal.</p>
<p>To put down some more precise goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to try out embedded rust development to see how it feels and possibly contribute
back some documentation</li>
<li>I want to fix <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/4917">a bug</a> where Clippy never stops running.</li>
<li>I want to continue with <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/2038">splitting up Clippy's UI test files</a> to make the output
more manageable.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's all I have for now. See you here for the January review!</p>

## New Sponsors

Thanks to [@oli-obk] and [@yaahc], my very first sponsors ðŸŽ‰

## What I've worked on

My main goal for October was getting all the sponsoring figured out and set up.
The first half of the month was more or less about figuring out all this stuff and
making sure sponsoring is fine with [my employer](https://esanum.com). This included:

- The [sponsoring blog post]
- The [thanks page]
- The GitHub [sponsorship profile]
- The Stripe account setup
- A [paypal.me profile]
- Lot's of research into crowdfunding

The second half of the month I had more time to work on Rust things:

* Continuing with annotate-snippet-rs
* [Fixing a Clippy bug](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pull/4721)
* [A small refactoring in rustc](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/65428)

Unfortunately I got sick with a strong cold at the end of the month and I'm
still recovering from it as I'm finishing up this post, so I'm going to keep
this months review a bit shorter and focus on getting healthy again.

This November I hope to finish up my two existing Clippy PRs ([1][one],
[2][two]) but I will also be on holiday for two weeks. The remaining time I
want to try and see how I can help out with the effort over at
[annotate-snippet-rs][annotate].

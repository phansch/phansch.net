      <div class="e-content"><p>The last few days have been quite a torture for me. 
The 22nd started with some major stomach ache for me. The pain was so intense, that I couldn't sleep the following night. So I called my dad and he brought me home the next day. The next three days I was on pain killers. But as the pain didn't go away I decided to go to the local hospital. Well, to make a long story short, it turned out that I have kidney stones. Right now I am half-way through with all the surgery stuff. The kidney stones are still there but don't cause as much pain as they did before. At this point I have a flexible tube between my kidney and my bladder to relieve my kidney. </p>
<p>The next step is to shatter the kidney stones so that they are small enough to eventually leave my body on their own..</p>
<p>So, what can be done to prevent kidney stones from forming? Turns out, not much. I live a somewhat healthy life. I drink enough water. I'm not smoking. I don't drink alcohol as regular as others do (I could be more athletic, tho..). Even my doctor told me there is nothing I could have done but going to the hospital a few days earlier to get some of the REALLY GOOD painkillers.</p>
<p><strong>Please don't take take any of the above as a medical advice.</strong> <strong>Always</strong> go to a doctor rather than looking things up on the internet. </p>
<p>With not much left to say, I wish everyone a happy new year and all the best for the future. Keep checking out my blog for new stuff in the next year! </p>

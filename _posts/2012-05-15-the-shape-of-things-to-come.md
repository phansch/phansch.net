Greetings!

As you might have noticed, the blog has been silent for a few <del>days</del> weeks. It will stay that way for a little while, but do not fret! The content drought was mainly due to me being a lazy asuran engineer and also because of a boat load of news after the first press beta event that I just couldn't (or didn't want to) keep up with. Head past the jump to see what's up.

I like lists, so here are three things that will change for plyturon.net, put into a list.



	
  * No more weekly wrap-ups until maybe a month after a release. There is just too much news out there right now.

        
  * Less posts about <del>centaurs</del> Guild Wars 2. Therefore more personal stuff.

	
  * Website theme not appropriate for new content, will change that once new content is ready to be published.



Thanks for your patience. 
Plyturon

      <div class="e-content"><p>Although I sort of talked about this on twitter already, I am happy to announce that I got accepted to <a href="http://www.hackership.org/">Hackership</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-hackership">What is Hackership</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Hackership is a self-directed, hands-on learning programme for Coders, Programmers and Software Developers to acquire new skills or become better at what they already do.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It's like an apprenticeship. But for hackers. A Hackership.
<small>http://www.hackership.org/ </small></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The program offers a distraction-free environment where you are responsible for what you learn. There
is no curriculum and no instructors. Instead there is a huge focus on self-directed learning, deliberate practice and reflective learning.
There will be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting">daily stand-ups</a> and weekly demos. Additionally there will be experienced hackers around to help people with difficult problems and to dig deeper into the technology. This first batch will be hosted by <a href="http://betahaus.de/">betahaus</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/about">Hackerschool New York</a> is a very similar program and has been running for three years already.</p>
<h2 id="what-and-how-i-want-to-learn">What and how I want to learn</h2>
<p>Primarily I want to learn Ruby on Rails and proper Test Driven Development. I already have an idea on how to get started with this. I will spend the first two or three days working through <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/">this</a> Ruby on Rails tutorial. After that, I will start to work on the actual project where I can apply all the things from the tutorial. Additionally I am going to use <a href="http://ankisrs.net/">Anki</a> cards for stuff that is hard to remember. I will also try to maintain a learning journal to regularly review my learning progress.</p>
<h2 id="the-actual-project">The actual project</h2>
<p>Once I'm done with the tutorial, I will start working on a website that helps people learn touch-typing. About a month ago I started to learn touch-typing on the German <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datei:Tastatur_dvorak_farbe_optimiert.jpg">Dvorak layout</a>. I tried all kinds of tools and websites but only a few supported the layout I chose. None of these were very fleshed out. I had a really tough time getting to my current 25 WPM.</p>

</a>
<p>Although I would love to share some more specifics, the project details aren't really fleshed out yet.</p>
<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking forward</h2>
<p>My goal is to get a position as a junior Ruby developer at the end of Hackership. However, I really need to put myself out there. I never did that until the beginning of this month. So apart from Hackership I will try to be at every event possible to deal with my social anxiety. While overcoming my anxiety might sound difficult, I am really looking forward to the times ahead.</p>

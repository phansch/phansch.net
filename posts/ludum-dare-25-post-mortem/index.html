      <div class="e-content"><p>This was my first time participating in a game jam. The jam was a blast, although I didn't like the theme: You are the villain. I spent the first hour brainstorming ideas for the theme and ended with a space shooter where you shoot at defenseless transport ships.</p>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/phansch/ludumdare25/tree/master">The source</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eX7fsD3Hbmc">the timelapse</a>. I didn't publish a playable version, yet. You can get it from github and swap out the music that's missing, to make it run.</p>

<h2 id="what-was-good">What was good</h2>
<ul>
<li>This is my first game that I pretty much finished. On a single weekend! I did pacman, breakout and pong clones in C# and Lua before, but I never really created a game on my own in such a short amount of time. </li>
<li>I learned a ton! (See below)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-went-wrong">What went wrong</h2>
<h4 id="too-many-firsts">Too many firsts</h4>
<ul>
<li>Only played around with Lua and Love2D for a week</li>
<li>Never did a screenlapse before</li>
<li>When the jam started, I had no idea how to create a good game soundtrack or where to get them</li>
<li>I also added a new library for managing game states on Saturday. I had to move a lot of code around.</li>
<li>Particle Systems in Love2D. </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="at-the-end-i-lost-my-motivation-to-finish-it">At the end I lost my motivation to finish it</h4>
<p>Therefore, the last sequence isn't implemented and the game doesn't really end. I am not sure how to stay motivated until the end, next time. </p>
<h4 id="i-focused-too-much-on-the-story-instead-of-making-the-game-work">I focused too much on the story instead of making the game work</h4>
<p>I want to blame this on the topic for this Ludum Dare. I had a story in mind where the player controls an alien spaceship, shooting at humans.
It turned out, that it was difficult to distinguish between aliens and humans. Therefore, I put in a lot of text that explains who you (the player) are.</p>
<p>Maybe there are better way to do this, but a space shooter where you are the villain was probably a bad idea in the first place.</p>
<h4 id="the-overall-gameplay-and-mechanics-are-lacking">The overall gameplay and mechanics are lacking</h4>
<p>Admittedly, I am not a game designer - rather a programmer. But I should put some more effort into this area next time.</p>

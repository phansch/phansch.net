I had some free time this weekend

## What changed

 * There are now only two circles to defend
 * More firing
 * New graphics
   * New bullet graphics
   * Planet got a sprite
 * New enemy
   * I talked about adding this one before. It's a strategic bomber that bombs your defense from a distance. It moves around the planet and keeps dropping bombs as long as it's not destroyed
 * Increased difficulty
   * Player has to make sure to not get hit by his own bullets

## What's left

 * Adding variety to bullets
   * AOE bombs

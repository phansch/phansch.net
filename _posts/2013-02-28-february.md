## My forever project
At the end of January, I started working on a sidescroller game. That was a mistake. I have never written a sidescroller before. So there were a lot of unexpected problems. First I got stuck on the camera system. I looked at other games and their implementations until I finally got a camera system working. Then I got stuck with collision detection. And how on earth would I implement the parallax scrolling? What about level design, animations, audio and story?

Additionally, I started learning for my upcoming university tests.

I *knew* I wasn't going to finish it in time for the February deadline of [OneGameAMonth](http://www.onegameamonth.com/).

## The solution
The solution was simple, literally.

Here's the Connect-Four clone I worked on in the past two days. It's not impressive or pretty, but I finished it in time.

### Running the game

1. If you don't have Love2D installed, download it [here](http://love2d.org/) and install it first.
2. Download the [.love](http://download.phansch.net/1GAM/February/Connect-Four.love) file.

To run the game:

 * On Linux, use `love /path/to/game.love` to run the game.
 * On Windows use `love C:\path\to\game.love`, double click the file, or drag the .love file onto love.exe
 * On Mac use `open -n -a love "/home/path/to/game"` or drag the .love file onto the Love.app application bundle

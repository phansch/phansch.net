      <div class="e-content"><p><em>This is the place where I talk about the progress on my quest on self-improvement. Follow me on this quest to a better self where you might learn something as well. Here's what I did last week in terms of self improvement, focusing on important stuff and getting rid of bad habits.</em></p>
<p>I finished Week 3 of c25k! I'm really getting into it and I started looking for my first official 5k run as well.
On <strong>Monday</strong> I finished a Geocaching presentation for English class. As English is not my native language I spent almost the whole day practicing my speaking.
<strong>Thursday</strong> was the day where I held my Geocaching presentation. I was quite nervous but according to my teacher there were next to no flaws!
On <strong>Friday</strong>, on the quest to leave my comfort zone more often, I went to uni to study Mobile Applications with a fellow student.
<strong>Saturday</strong> evening my uni took part in Berlin Science Open Door. I paid a short visit to see what people were presenting.
Did I mention that my <a href="http://www.amazon.de/Wildfox-Gjende-1-2-Personen-Zelt/dp/B003D5U4GY">tent</a> arrived on <strong>Sunday</strong>? Yes, finally! However, all the other equipment is still missing. :(</p>
<p>As for other stuff, I ...</p>
<h2 id="simplified-things">... simplified things</h2>
<p>Previously, I had my documents all over the place and emails/contacts/calendar only accessible at one computer. This week I fixed that. 
I simplified stuff by using <strong>Google Mail/Calendar</strong> instead of Outlook. I'm also using <strong>Google Drive</strong> to save my documents now. This somewhat saves me from doing regular backups of my documents. 
For note taking I'm using <a href="http://evernote.com/">Evernote</a>. Evernote also lets you sync over different devices. I use Evernote to write up my long term goals, class notes and ideas in general. 
For short term tasks I'm using <a href="http://wunderlist.com">Wunderlist</a>, which lets you sync over different devices as well! 
This way I have all my stuff wherever I need it.</p>
<h2 id="got-rid-of-internet-distractions">... got rid of internet distractions</h2>
<p>When I'm programming I don't want to be distracted. Once I do something else, I would lose at least 5 minutes by getting into the code again. So I tried to get rid of as many distractions as possible. 
First, I <strong>disabled Google Mail notifications</strong>. I only check my mail three times every day now. 
Second, I got rid of MetroTwit's <strong>Twitter notifications</strong>. This was a HUGE change and an easy one. I don't feel like I want to enable them ever again. 
Apart from that, I disabled <strong>Skype and Steam notifications</strong> as well as several <strong>software update notifications</strong>. 
The next thing was my biggest distraction. The <strong>browser bookmark sidebar</strong>. I can only encourage you to either get rid of the sidebar or remove all the distracting bookmarks. This greatly increased my productivity. 
I also learned that when I have <strong>lots of tabs</strong> open, my productivity goes down. So, for now I'm trying to take a look at my tab count every 5 minutes to cut down on tabs I no longer need. By doing this I'm making sure that I'm staying on one task only.</p>
